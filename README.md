# GWecc_1psr_search

This repository contains the search scripts for a Bayesian single-pulsar search for nanohertz gravitational waves originating from eccentric supermassive binaries, done using the NANOGrav 12.5-year dataset for PSR J1909-3744. The analysis is presented in [Susobhanan 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11454), and the resulting posterior samples are available [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8028583).

These scripts depend on [GWecc.jl](https://github.com/abhisrkckl/GWecc.jl), [ENTERPRISE](https://github.com/nanograv/enterprise), [enterprise_extensions](https://github.com/nanograv/enterprise_extensions), [PTMCMCSampler](https://github.com/jellis18/PTMCMCSampler), and [corner](https://github.com/dfm/corner.py).
